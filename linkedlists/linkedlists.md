Linked lists (ADT)
------------------

### Main operations
 - Insert, Delete

### Auxiliary operations
 - Delete List, Count, Find nth node from the end of the list

Doubly linked list
------------------

### Advantages
- It has the address of both previous node and next node, So unlike linked list we need not have a pointer to the previous node in order to delete it


### Disadvantages
 - Each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space
 - insertion or deletion of a node takes little longer, because of more pointer operations.
